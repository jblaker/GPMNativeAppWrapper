Google Play Music WebApp Wrapper
===================

A simple WebView wrapper for Google Play Music with dock controls (play/pause, next, previous, thumbs up, thumbs down), OS X notifications, scrobbling and share to twitter support and Apple keyboard playback control support.

[Here is a compiled version of the app for those who just want to use it.](http://dev.blakerdesign.com/misc/GooglePlayMusic.zip)

Please feel free to contribute and enhance this project. Hopefully some day we'll have an official native app.
